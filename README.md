# To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Aim -> To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.

Theory -> Bitwise Operators are the operators that are used to perform operations on the bit level on the integers. While performing this operation integers are considered as sequences of binary digits.
Its symbols and functions are as follows:
1. Bitwise AND (&)
2. Bitwise OR (|)
3. Bitwise XOR (^)
4. Bitwise NOT (~)
5. Left Shift (<<)
6. Right Shift (>>)

Output:

Conclusion -> I learnt about bitwise operators.
